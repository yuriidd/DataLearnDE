Sure, I can guide you through the process of deploying your Docker Compose application to Azure using Azure CLI. Here are the steps:
Install Azure CLI: If you havenâ€™t installed Azure CLI on your machine, you can download it from the official Azure download page.
Login to Azure: Open your terminal and run the following command to login to Azure:


az login
Follow the instructions to complete the login process.
Create a Resource Group: Run the following command to create a new resource group named rg-surfalytics-docker:


az group create --name rg-surfalytics-docker --location <location>
Replace <location> with the location where you want to create your resource group, such as westus.
Create an Azure Container Instance (ACI): Now, you can create an Azure Container Instance using your Docker Compose file. Run the following command:


az container create --resource-group rg-surfalytics-docker --file <path-to-docker-compose.yml> --dns-name-label <dns-name-label>
Replace <path-to-docker-compose.yml> with the path to your Docker Compose file and <dns-name-label> with a unique DNS name label.
Access your Application: Once the deployment is successful, you can access your application at http://<dns-name-label>.<location>.azurecontainer.io.
Please replace <location>, <path-to-docker-compose.yml>, and <dns-name-label> with your actual values. Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š

============================


Iâ€™m sorry for the confusion. The error message indicates that the admin user for your Azure Container Registry (ACR) is disabled. The admin user is a pre-created user that has push/pull permissions to the ACR.
You can enable the admin user and retrieve the username and password with the following commands:
Enable the admin user:


az acr update --name surfalyticsregistry --admin-enabled true


Get the credentials:


az acr credential show --name surfalyticsregistry
The second command will output the username and passwords for your ACR. You can use these credentials to login to your ACR.
Please note that using the admin account for ACR is convenient for a quick start but itâ€™s not recommended for production scenarios. For production scenarios, itâ€™s recommended to use an Azure Active Directory service principal or managed identity that has the appropriate role assigned.
Let me know if you need further assistance! ðŸ˜Š



=============================


az acr login --name surfalyticsregistry





az container exec --resource-group demoazur --name combined-container-group --container-name redis --exec-command "/bin/bash"
